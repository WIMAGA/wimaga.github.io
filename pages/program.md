The workshop will comprise invited keynote talks, with peer-reviewed papers presented as posters (including dataset papers, demo papers, state of the art reviews and application papers). We also plan events leading up to the workshop and dedicated breakout sessions on several community-sourced topics to foster interdisciplinary collaborations across different communities. Detailed program will be announced as we have additional details.
